# Crypto Price Tracker

This is a React app that fetches data from the CoinGecko API to display the current price of cryptocurrencies in real-time along with the different exchanges. The app is built using Chakra UI for the UI components, Chart.js for creating dynamic charts to visualize price trends over time, Framer Motion for animations, Axios for making API requests, and React Icons for including popular icons.
